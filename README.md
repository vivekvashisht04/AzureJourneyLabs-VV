# Azure Journey Labs - Documentation

Welcome to my Azure Journey Labs repository! This repository serves as a central hub for documenting my ongoing cloud journey, particularly as I prepare for the AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator exam. My goal is to not only prepare for this certification but to also continue exploring and documenting my experiences with Cloud Technologies beyond the exam.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to share the hands-on lab documents and screenshots that I've created while studying and practicing Azure technologies. By documenting these labs, I aim to:

- Enhance my own understanding and retention of cloud concepts.
- Provide a resource for others who are learning Azure or preparing for the AZ-104 exam.
- Encourage collaboration and feedback from the community to improve understanding and solutions.

## Lab Documents
Within this repository, you'll find detailed lab instructions and corresponding screenshots for each exercise. These documents are intended to give you a comprehensive view of the tasks performed and the Azure features explored.

### Featured Labs
- **Azure Cost Management Tools**: Focuses on managing and organizing Azure resources efficiently.
- **Azure Identities**: Covers managing Azure Active Directory and role-based access controls.
- **Azure Virtual Machines**: Deals with setting up and managing virtual machines within the Azure ecosystem.

## Engage and Connect
I encourage you to explore the labs and reach out if you have any questions or need further insights. Whether you're also preparing for an Azure certification or just interested in cloud technologies, your feedback and insights are highly welcome.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope it serves as a valuable resource on your own cloud journey!
