# Azure Journey Labs - Documentation

Welcome to my Azure Journey Labs repository! This repository serves as a central hub for documenting my ongoing cloud journey, particularly as I was preparing for the AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator exam. My goal was to not only prepare for the certification but to also continue exploring and documenting my experiences with Cloud Technologies beyond the exam.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to share the hands-on lab documents and screenshots that I've created while studying and practicing Azure technologies. By documenting these labs, I aim to:

- Enhance my own understanding and retention of cloud concepts.
- Provide a resource for others who are learning Azure or preparing for the AZ-104 exam.
- Encourage collaboration and feedback from the community to improve understanding and solutions.

## Lab Documents
Within this repository, you'll find detailed lab instructions and corresponding screenshots for each exercise. These documents are intended to give you a comprehensive view of the tasks performed and the Azure features explored.
